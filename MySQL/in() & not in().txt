MySQL IN() function finds a match in the given arguments.
    The function returns 1 if expr is equal to any of the values in the IN list, otherwise, returns 0.
    If all values are constants, they are evaluated according to the type of expr and sorted.
    The search for the item then is done using a binary search.
    This means IN is very quick if the IN value list consists entirely of constants.
    Otherwise, type conversion takes place according to the rules.  --w3resource

Syntax:
    expr IN (value,...)


MySQL NOT IN() makes sure that the expression proceeded does not have any of the values present in the arguments.  --w3resource

Syntax:
    expr NOT IN (value,...)
